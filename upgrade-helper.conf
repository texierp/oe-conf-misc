# This file is your upgrade-helper configuration files and is where all local user
# settings specifically for AUH are placed. The comments in this file provide some
# guidelines to the options a new user to AUH tool might want to change.
#
# This file should be placed inside your BUILDDIR/upgrade-helper after initializing
# the OE build environment (this location can be overriden with -c command line option).
#
# Lines starting with the '#' character are commented out and in some cases the
# default values are provided as comments to show people example syntax. Enabling
# the option is a question of removing the # character and making any change to the
# variable as required.

# SMTP server that is used to send e-mails with patches and other information.

# Buildhistory and testimages will be created only for the first

# AUH has a reasonable default for this, so you do not need to set your own,
# at least initially.

# about what has changed in the resulting packages, compared to previous version
#buildhistory=yes

# When AUH has built an upgraded recipe it then creates a commit with the upgrade.
# This setting specifies whether to also revert the commit. Possible values are:
# 'failed_to_build' (default) - revert if the recipe failed to build. This is useful
# to prevent further upgrades in the batch from failing, if they're dependent on the
# recipe.
# 'all' - always revert. This is useful when running automatic, unattended upgrades,
#  as it will effectively test each upgrade against the baseline, and will avoid the 
# situation where one successful upgrade thwarts others due to newly introduced 
# incompatibilities.
# 'never' - never revert. Use in interactive upgrade sessions, where any issues can be
# manually fixed.
#commit_revert_policy=failed_to_build

# If enabled, build and boots a test image, and runs integration tests on it
# If upgraded packages have ptest support those are run as well
#testimage=no
#
# This can be used to change the name of the test image.
#

# for example meta-intel, instead of upgrading oe-core recipes.
